## Understanding the feasibility of storage technology solutions for ESO

The project was developed to propose a solution to ESO to achieve the Next Zero target by 2050 for the GB-wide energy system. In particular, the project was about understanding where different storage technology (e.g., short duration tech solution) solutionsÂ are needed when there exists a shortfall of energy from renewable sources.

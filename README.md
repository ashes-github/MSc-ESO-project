## Understanding the feasibility of storage technology solutions for ESO

The project was developed to propose a solution to ESO to achieve the Next Zero target by 2050 for the GB-wide energy system. In particular, the project was about understanding where different storage technology (e.g., short duration tech solution in this case) solutionsÂ are needed when there exists a shortfall of energy from renewable sources.

**Objective**
The objective was to identify Grid Supply Points (GSPs) suitable for installing short-duration storage technology solutions like battery by signal analysis and develop a probabilistic machine learning model to visualise those suitable GSPs in 2D latent space derived from their very high dimensional space.
